My name is Joe Bahr, and I am a Master's candidate at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy.

After working for four years in grocery retail as a data scientist, I am excited to explore the world of data science in the context of policy.  

Since entering the industry, the tools and methods available to data scientists has grown enormously.  Furthermore, I have spent time dabbling with the publicly available data published by cities and am enthused by the amount of data available.  This combination is truly exciting, and I hope to share that enthusiasm via this blog.
