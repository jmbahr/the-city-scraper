    "Text analytics represents a growing set of tools to uncover insights on texts of interest.  In industry, this may include mining customer reviews or .\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of tools is strong and enables us to 'listen' to people in a programmatic way.  Text analytics obviously has limitations compared to the understanding that comes from an actual human reading the text, but for processing large amounts of data it can be an effective tool within the confines of its limitations."

    "This notebook will demonstrate various text mining techniques, with our subject being 3-1-1 call data.  3-1-1 Call Centers are common in municipalities and represent a non-emergency hotline for residents to contact.  Incidents reported include fallen limbs, potholes, overgrown footprints, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text mining was a new topic for me.  I have been exposed to trainings in the past but have never wandered into the wild lands of raw text descriptions and tried to make better sense of them programmatically.  This ended up being a fun exercise with a ton of text cleaning and I learned a lot - I hope you do as well!"

    "## Why is this Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying and accessing data is a fundamental step of any data science workflow.  The mechanics of accessing data can get very messy, especially when it comes to government data.  Examples of this messiness include manually downloading files and saving to a user-defined location, appending multiple Excel files, scraping PDFs, and the list goes on.  Bottom line: it can get MESSY.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the infrastructure provided by Socrata makes for a seamless experience that can be replicated by anyone with the Internet and Python.  You read that correctly, everything demonstrated in this post can be replicated with very little setup.  This is a huge perk for the sake of collaboration.  Additionally, in the event that an analysis needs to be re-run, perhaps on more recent data, the ability to query data programatically allows for minimal rework and minimal room for error.  Alright, enough hype let's get to it!"
